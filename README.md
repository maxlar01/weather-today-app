# WeatherToday Web App
A simple web app that displays the temperature of an area located in the US based on the zipcode you enter. The front-end was built using pure HTML, CSS and Javascript. The back-end uses Express.js and [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API to fetch the weather data. This project was a part of Udacity web development nanodegree üòÑ.

## Notes
The web app needs an API key to work so you need to register an account (it's free!) at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) and create an API key. You can use it directly inside "app.js" to test the web app.
